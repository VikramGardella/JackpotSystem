Rough draft of one of the automated systems that I designed for Amazon's CVG2 warehouse facility. This system was projected to significantly cut staffing costs by 100+ man-hours per 24-hour period for each ReLo facility that it is implemented.

(100 man-hours) * ($20/hour average salary) * (300 days of facility operation/year) = $600,000 reduction in running costs per facility.
