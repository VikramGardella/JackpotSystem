# Automated Warehouse System for Amazon
This repository contains a prototype of an automated system designed for Amazon's CVG2 warehouse facility. The system aimed to reduce staffing costs by over 100 man-hours per 24-hour period at each ReLo facility where it would be implemented.

## Projected Cost Savings
By reducing manual labor requirements, this system was estimated to save:

(
100
 man-hours
)
×
(
$
20
/
hour average salary
)
×
(
300
 operational days/year
)
=
$
600
,
000
 in annual cost reductions per facility.
(100 man-hours)×($20/hour average salary)×(300 operational days/year)=$600,000 in annual cost reductions per facility.
## Project Impact
If fully deployed, this system would have significantly improved efficiency, reduced labor dependency, and increased overall profitability for Amazon’s warehouse operations.
